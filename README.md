# EMPLOYEE ATTRITION VIA PYTHON  

## Introduction 
Employee attrition is inevitable; however, it is essential to keep a close eye on attrition as it can effect progress with in companies. Some problems may include tasks being overlooked, department miscommunications, and unhappy employees. Benefits of keeping a record of employee attrition can aid in employee satisfaction, decrease in cost, and keeping long term employees. 


## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the following:
-	Can monthly income play a role in attrition? 
-	Does one department have a higher attrition rate than another? 
-	Will Travel Distance play a role in attrition rate? 
-	Can Income play a role in attrition? 
-	Monthly Income and distance from home have an effect on Attrition?
  
## Tools
-	Visual Studio Code (VSC) 
-	Git 
-	GitHub
-	Python
-	Anaconda
-	Matplotlib
-	Numpy
-	Seaborn

## Analysis



## Conclusion 
-	Millennials are more likely to quit than other generations. 
-	Males are more likely than females to quit.
-	The Research and Development department is more likely to quit based off other departments.
-	Employees with Doctoral Degrees are more likely to quit than other categories.

## Further Research
Further research should investigate how gender is playing a role in attrition. I was interested to see that Males were more likely to quit verses females. In industry organizational psychology we learned about the gender gap and how females are more likely to quit because of job burnout and family conflicts. I am curious to see if times have changed and women are now staying in the workforce longer.
